# dsn_ai_bootcamp_2020
This repository contains the code to my final submission for the Data Science Nigeria AI boot camp 2020.

The problem solved was to predict the probability that a customer would default a loan or not, using the logloss as the evaluation metric.
After testing several algorithm and doing several hyper parameters tuning, I was able to conclude on using the soft voting classifier as it gave me the highest accuracy.
